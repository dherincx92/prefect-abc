  An abstract class for a prefect `flow`. If this class is instantiated,
  you will receive a TypeError since the `build` method has no actual
  implementation. Rather, this class must be inherited by another class that
  overrides and implements the actual flow logic.

  What this means is that any user can import `AbstractFlow` and simply
  override the abstract `build` method with their specific `flow` logic.

  Note: for this version of the class, we are only supporting prefect's
  `cron` scheduler. If an invalid `cron` string is used, a `ValueError` will
  be raised during instantiation. For help on forming cron strings, I recommend
  `crontab.guru.com`.
